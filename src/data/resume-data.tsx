      description: 
        "Performed experiments on high frame rate videos of patients with abnormal blinking. Emphasized low-budget active learning on keypoint detection tasks using contrastive learning and sequence encoding. Aimed to reduce data that is required to be annotated by ophthalmologists."

      description: "Utilized mosquito wing beat sound to conduct experiments on a designed and implemented noise-robust sound event detection model. The model was trained on environmental noise, in which some portion had been overlayed realistically with mosquitoâ€™s wing beat sound, then predicted when and which species and sex of mosquitoes were present in the given audio."

      description: "Experimented on CT scans using segmentation and classification models to detect the brain disease. Designed a pipeline that can be trained using weakly supervised data, which does not require clinical annotation. The designed pipeline has more sensitivity than radiologist and thus could be used as a screening tool which reduce time for the physicians and the patients."
